# Walmart-retail-analysis
Retail analysis with Walmart
The aim of this project was to overcome the business challenge faced by Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, due to unforeseen demands and out-of-stock issues. Walmart would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index as also the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks.
